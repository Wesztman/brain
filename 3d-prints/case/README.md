# 3D printed case for the Brain

The case is specifically designed to be used with a foam layer (~2mm) between the PCB and the case for additional cushioning and to reduce the noise of the switches. Additionally, the case includes 8x rubber feet holes (8mm in diameter) to provide additional stability and prevent the case from sliding around during use.
