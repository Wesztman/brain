# 3D Print case for the brain

The case is specifically designed to be used with a foam layer between the PCB and the case for additional cushioning and to reduce the noise of the switches. Additionally, the case includes 8x rubber feet holes to provide additional stability and prevent the case from sliding around during use.

## Design

The design is split into two parts, one for each half of the split keyboard. The case has screw holes that match M2 screws, which can be used to fasten the case together. However, the case can also sit fine with just friction.
